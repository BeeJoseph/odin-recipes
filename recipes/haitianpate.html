        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>All you need is <strong>two</strong> squares of a chicken filled Haitian pate to make you full. Enjoy this in place of a everyday-average sandwhich at work for a quick savory pick-me-up. After eating this, you may favor the crust over the meat flling, or vice versa. Whichever it is, you won't be able to put <em>any</em> part of it down.<p>
